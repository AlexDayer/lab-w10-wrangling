# Some NSF Funding for Cognitive Science #

This repository analyzes NSF awards for cognitive science-related research, looking at three programs:  Perception, Action, and Cognition (7252); Robust Intelligence (7495); and Understanding the Brain (8089).  

# Data Retrieval #

Data were downloaded by DJH on 2020-02-28 from [NSF's Advanced Award Search tools](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/advancedSearch.jsp).  The searches were for the three programs, including expired awards, and were exported as XLS files.  
To show the data for a single award by ID, follow the example of this URL: <https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1948510>

## Date Mangling ##

To simulate the result of Excel date mangling, DJH exported the XLS files to CSV, imported them into Excel without specifying the format of the date columns, and then saving the result in XLSX format.
